save_IntermediateFiles_Clim.m & save_IntermediateFiles_FULL.m:
custom-built by Donny Kim.
Provides a function to save intermediate outputs (out/comid_n/intermediate).
Such includes three diagnostic csv files, and two mat binary files.
These are saved after running CEEMDAN and LowFreq_PreAnalysis (including broken line process).
Work around the trouble caused by MATLAB's "table" datatype in GNU Octave.


load_IntermediateFiles_Clim.m & load_IntermediateFiles_FULL.m:
custom-built by Donny Kim.
Intended for loading two mat binary files from intermediate outputs.
This function can be useful when script crashes at GetStochPertData phase.
Work around the trouble caused by MATLAB's "table" datatype in GNU Octave.


preprocess_table2csv.m:
custom-built by Donny Kim.
A messy work-around to preprocess "table" datatype into "cell array".
This allows to use cell2csv function to save csv files from "table" without crashing.


cell2table.m & struct2table.m:
From tablicious package (https://github.com/apjanke/octave-tablicious).
These are essential for all of the custom-built functions introduced above.
Allows to deal with problems caused by MATLAB's "table" datatype in GNU Octave.
